# Tasks solved and this is application functionality

- Structure of the message sending form: name, text, button
- The message is sent by clicking on the button and by Ctrl + Enter
- A new message is added without reloading the page
- A new message is added to the beginning (top) of the message list
- Messages sorted in descending order by date (newest at the top)
- New message contains sender's name and text
- After a forced reload of the page, the message does not disappear, does not move
- When entering the page from another browser, the message remains in place (data storage on the server)
 `Frontend`
- Used any of the UI frameworks
- Adaptive layout
- On hover and other events, application elements do not move
- JS form validation and error notifications
   >- Visually empty fields cannot be sent
   >- You cannot send the field name with invalid characters (allowed: latin letters, numbers, underscore)
   >- Here is a notification about which field is the error
   >- Error notification is hidden when you start typing in the corresponding field
   >- Error notifications when appearing do not shift other fields
   >- Regular expressions are used in validation (for example, the prohibition of adding hyperlinks) - Formik is used in the test
- Server responses processed (message added, not added ...)
- Here are no extra renders
- Used hooks useState, useCallback and others
- After submitting the form, the message text field is cleared
- After submitting the form, the author field is NOT cleared
- Environment variables used
  `Backend`
- The code is structured
- Database used
- Errors are handled
- When adding a message, the server returns a status and a new message (not the entire list)
- Incoming data is validated
